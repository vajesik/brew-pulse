## About This Project
This project was our second group project for Flatiron School. We landed on using the Open Brewery DB API, since we both enjoy a good brew and the API itself was incredibly clean and easy to use. This project focused on honing our skills in React. The app itself allows users to review a pre-selected brewery, "like" breweries, and also search through breweries themselves via zip code or city & state. You can go to links to their websites and view the addresses of each brewery. We hope you enjoy this project, because we definitely enjoyed creating it over the past week.
